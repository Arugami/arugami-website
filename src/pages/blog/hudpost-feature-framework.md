## Why HudPost matters in Hudson County

HudPost is the region’s loudest local microphone with 200K+ followers and readers who care about community wins. Our partnership guarantees you a slot every month, but the feature itself is only step one. Here’s the framework we follow to turn each story into long-term visibility.

## Step 1 → Nail the angle

We choose from three proven narratives:

1. **Local legend** – highlights the founder, block, and cultural roots.
2. **Smart systems** – shows how you are using automation to serve Hudson County faster.
3. **Community impact** – showcases partnerships, jobs, and donations that resonate with residents.

Before we pitch, we confirm which KPI the angle supports (bookings, reviews, partnerships).

## Step 2 → Prep assets in advance

- **Photography & b-roll** – we deliver a folder of rooftop, in-store, and team shots sized for HudPost and your own channels.
- **Quote library** – soundbites that reinforce foundation-first messaging and the KPIs you’re tracking.
- **CTA alignment** – we set up campaign-specific landing pages (reservations, consultation, event RSVP) so traffic converts.

## Step 3 → Launch day amplification

Once the feature goes live:

- Send it to your list with a 3-step email + SMS sequence.
- Post native edits on Instagram, Facebook, TikTok, and Google Business Profile.
- Update the "Featured In" strip on your site and location pages.

We monitor spike metrics for 72 hours—traffic, bookings, review prompts—and annotate them inside your dashboard.

## Step 4 → Long-tail repurposing

Every feature becomes:

- **Website proof** – embed quotes and stats onto service + location pages (hello, conversion lift).
- **Paid retargeting creative** – we build square and vertical cuts featuring the HudPost logo for social ads.
- **Sales enablement** – give your team the link and key metrics to close wary prospects.

## The KPI bundle we track

- Referral traffic + conversions from HudPost URL parameters.
- Map Pack rank changes (HudPost backlinks help).
- Review mentions referencing the article.
- Social reach and saves from repurposed content.

Each month the loop repeats, ensuring you never disappear from local feeds. If you want your HudPost coverage to do more than generate likes, follow this framework—or have us run it for you.
