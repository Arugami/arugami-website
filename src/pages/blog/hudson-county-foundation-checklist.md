## Why the foundation sprint matters

Most Hudson County businesses come to us with the same problems: outdated sites, buried Google Business Profiles (GBP), and phones that go unanswered after 6 PM. Before we layer HudPost coverage or automation, we run a 45-day sprint to fix the basics. This checklist shows exactly what we tackle and the KPIs we use to prove it worked.

## Day 1-15 → Website credibility

- **Conversion-first rebuild** – mobile-first layout, above-the-fold proof, bilingual CTAs when needed.
- **Performance + accessibility audit** – we target sub-2.5s LCP, pass Core Web Vitals, and ensure forms are keyboard-friendly.
- **Schema & metadata pass** – LocalBusiness, Service, and FAQ schema so search engines understand who you serve.

_Resulting KPI_: baseline site conversion rate so we can measure lift later.

## Day 10-25 → Google Business Profile dominance

- **GBP clean-up** – verify ownership, correct categories, and sync hours with real operations.
- **Photo & video upload plan** – every business gets a bank of culture-forward imagery sized for search.
- **Review velocity system** – QR cards, SMS prompts, and templated replies so we gather a steady stream of five-star feedback.

_Resulting KPI_: Map Pack rank movements and review growth velocity.

## Day 20-35 → Lead capture + smart routing

- **CRM configuration** – unify phone, SMS, chat, webforms, and socials inside one inbox.
- **AI receptionist launch** – bilingual scripts that answer FAQs, qualify leads, and book appointments within seconds.
- **Notification matrix** – routing rules ensure on-call team members never miss an opportunity.

_Resulting KPI_: Average reply time (our target: under 60 seconds across channels).

## Day 30-45 → Reporting + hand-off

- **KPI dashboard** – we summarize site conversion, GBP visibility, review velocity, and response times.
- **Operational playbooks** – checklists for your team so the foundation stays healthy without guesswork.
- **HudPost readiness** – we prep story angles and media kits so your first feature lands right after the sprint.

_Resulting KPI_: Stakeholder-ready report and timeline for HudPost + automation phases.

## What happens next

With the foundation locked, we transition into social/content engines, HudPost coverage, and the automations that keep you busy. If you try to skip the sprint, you simply push weak links further down the road. Start here, then pour fuel on it.
